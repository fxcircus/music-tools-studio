# Music Tools Studio

A simple set of tools to help musicians stay creative and focused.

## Features

- **Flow Timer**: A Pomodoro-style timer to help you stay focused while writing, practicing, or producing.

- **Inspiration Generator**: Get instant musical ideas with random root notes, scales, BPM, and instrument suggestions. Lock in what you like and shuffle the rest.
