Fleet Foxes often use a folk-inspired sound with rich harmonies and acoustic instrumentation. One key that can work well for writing a song in their style is:

Scale name: Mixolydian Mode
Scale notes:

Root (tonic)
Major second
Major third
Perfect fourth
Perfect fifth
Major sixth
Minor seventh
In the key of C, the Mixolydian mode would have the following notes:

C (Root)
D
E
F
G
A
Bb
This scale has a slightly different flavor compared to the standard major scale because of the lowered seventh note (Bb instead of B). It gives a folk or country-like feel and can be heard in many Fleet Foxes songs. Combine this scale with intricate vocal harmonies and acoustic instrumentation, and you're on your way to capturing their style.

Simplify your message and let the emotions flow naturally, and don't be afraid to strip away anything that doesn't serve the song's core essence. Trust your instincts and create music that resonates deeply with you, as genuine artistry often stems from an authentic connection to the music.
